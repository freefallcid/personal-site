Organising your code in large React apps can be a bit of a balancing act. One of the hardest but least talked about things to get right is figuring out where to put all your files. After working a lot with Ruby on Rails with it's [*convention over configuration*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convention_over_configuration) ideology I've seen the value of everyone on the team knowing where things should be. For the sake of your sanity and the sanity of those you work with it's important that you have a structure that can be reasoned about, and which is easy to scale.
