I've made quite a few React apps now, both out in the wild with real users and in some hobby projects. One of the hardest but least talked about things to get right is figuring out where to put all your files. After working a lot in Ruby on Rails with it's "convention over configuration" ideology I've seen the value of everyone on the team knowing where things should be. For the sake of your sanity and the sanity of those you work with it's important to get it right!
