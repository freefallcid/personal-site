Re: Vanilla CSS

Good:
Can be used by other parts of your site or app that may not be React-based. This is not true of *any* of the other solutions.

Bad (corrections):
No, you donâ€™t need any special webpack config. Just put a <link> to add your stylesheet to the page ðŸ™„.
And if concatenating class name strings is too hard, thereâ€™s always https://www.npmjs.com/package/classnames
