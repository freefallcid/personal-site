you didn't mention style-jsx which I think offers a bit more then styled-components

https://github.com/zeit/styled-jsx

instead of sending the library style-jsx compiles into regular css in it's not dynamic
and also handles dynamic styles
and allows you to use pre and post processors

and looks more like style tags (less of a learning curve)
