Hi Keith, thanks for your comment and for reading my article.

The title of the article is "Styling React Components" so I was really only discussing how to do styles in React here, although you could happily use CSS Modules outside of React as well. I do agree with you though, in a more traditional web app vanilla CSS/Sass is probably more appropriate.

Simply adding the stylesheet in a link tag is always an option, but presumably you'll want some kind of build step for minification/concatenation/prefixing so you may as well handle that in your existing build process, be that Webpack or something else.

`classnames` is a nice package which I've used before, it's still not as neat as alternatives though in my opinion, and you'll miss out on all the other bonuses and optimisations that come along with using Styled Components. The class name strings are not the main problem, it's just a bonus that some of these solutions make it easier.
